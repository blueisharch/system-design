# 🌐 DNS — Domain Name System

> **One-liner:** DNS is the internet's phone book — it translates human-readable domain names (google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (142.250.195.78).

---

## 📌 Why DNS Exists

Computers communicate using **IP addresses** (numbers), but humans remember **names**. DNS bridges this gap.

Without DNS, you'd have to type `142.250.195.78` instead of `google.com`.

## 🔍 DNS Resolution — Step by Step

```
You type: www.google.com
```

1. **Browser Cache** — Did I look this up recently? (TTL-based)
2. **OS Cache / hosts file** — `/etc/hosts` on Linux/Mac
3. **Recursive Resolver** (your ISP or 8.8.8.8) — The middleman
4. **Root Name Server** — Knows who handles `.com`
5. **TLD Name Server** — Knows who handles `google.com`
6. **Authoritative Name Server** — Returns the final IP address
7. Response cached at each level with a **TTL**

## 🗂️ DNS Record Types

| Record | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **A** | Domain → IPv4 address | `google.com → 142.250.195.78` |
| **AAAA** | Domain → IPv6 address | `google.com → 2607:f8b0::...` |
| **CNAME** | Alias → another domain | `www.google.com → google.com` |
| **MX** | Mail server for domain | `google.com → smtp.google.com` |
| **NS** | Name server for domain | `google.com → ns1.google.com` |
| **TXT** | Arbitrary text (SPF, verification) | `v=spf1 include:...` |
| **PTR** | Reverse lookup (IP → domain) | `142.250.195.78 → google.com` |
| **SOA** | Start of Authority — zone metadata | Serial, TTL defaults |

---

## ⏱️ TTL (Time to Live)

TTL controls how long a DNS record is **cached** before being re-fetched.

| TTL | Use Case |
|-----|---------|
| `60s` | Frequent changes (A/B deployments) |
| `300s` | Default for most records |
| `86400s` (1 day) | Stable records (MX, NS) |

**⚠️ Before migrating servers: lower TTL to 60s first, wait for propagation, then change IP.**

## 🌍 DNS Hierarchy

```
               Root (.)
              /    |    \
          .com   .org   .io
          /
      google.com
      /         \
  www           mail
```

---

## 🔄 DNS Caching Layers

```
Browser Cache (seconds-minutes)
    ↓ miss
OS / hosts file
    ↓ miss
Recursive Resolver (ISP / 8.8.8.8)  ← caches for TTL
    ↓ miss
Root → TLD → Authoritative
```

## 🛡️ DNS Security

| Threat | Description | Defense |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **DNS Spoofing** | Attacker poisons cache with fake records | DNSSEC |
| **DNS Hijacking** | ISP/government redirects queries | Use encrypted DNS (DoH, DoT) |
| **DDoS on DNS** | Flood resolver to take down domains | Anycast DNS (Cloudflare, AWS Route 53) |

- **DNSSEC** — Cryptographically signs DNS records
- **DoH (DNS over HTTPS)** — Encrypts DNS queries
- **DoT (DNS over TLS)** — Alternative encryption standard

## ⚡ DNS in System Design

### Load Balancing via DNS
```
api.myapp.com  →  [DNS Round Robin]
                  → 10.0.0.1
                  → 10.0.0.2
                  → 10.0.0.3
```
Simple but no health checks — if a server dies, DNS still routes to it until TTL expires.

### GeoDNS
Different IPs returned based on user's location:
```
api.myapp.com from India → 13.235.x.x (Mumbai)
api.myapp.com from US   → 54.144.x.x (Virginia)
```

### Failover via DNS
Change A record to backup server when primary fails. But limited by TTL propagation delay.

The diagram shows:
- Full DNS resolution chain (Browser → OS → Resolver → Root → TLD → Auth)
- TTL cache at each layer
- GeoDNS routing to different regions

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- DNS resolution is **hierarchical and cached**
- Lower TTL before changing server IPs to avoid downtime
- DNS alone is a bad load balancer (no health checks)
- Modern DNS services (Cloudflare, Route 53) offer much more than just name resolution

# 🌐 IP & Networking Basics

> **One-liner:** IP (Internet Protocol) is the addressing system of the internet — every device gets a unique address, and packets are routed between them.

## 📌 IP Addresses

### IPv4
- 32-bit address → 2³² = ~4.3 billion addresses (running out!)
- Format: `192.168.1.1` (four 8-bit octets, 0–255)
- Private ranges (not routable on internet):
  - `10.0.0.0/8`
  - `172.16.0.0/12`
  - `192.168.0.0/16`

### IPv6
- 128-bit address → 2¹²⁸ = ~340 undecillion addresses
- Format: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- Solves IPv4 exhaustion problem

## 🔢 Ports

A port is a **logical channel** on an IP address. One server can run many services on different ports.

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 22 | SSH |
| 25 | SMTP (email) |
| 53 | DNS |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 3306 | MySQL |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL |
| 6379 | Redis |
| 27017 | MongoDB |

Ports 0–1023 = well-known (require root). Ports 1024–65535 = available.

## 📦 TCP vs UDP

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Connection-oriented — 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- **Reliable** — guarantees delivery, ordering, error checking
- **Slower** — overhead of acknowledgments
- Use: HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, databases

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Connectionless — just fire and forget
- **Unreliable** — no delivery guarantee, no ordering
- **Fast** — no handshake overhead
- Use: DNS, video streaming, gaming, VoIP

```
TCP: SYN ──► SYN-ACK ◄── ACK (connection established, then data)
UDP: DATA ──► (no response needed, no connection)
```

## 🏠 NAT (Network Address Translation)

Your router at home has ONE public IP. All your devices share it via NAT.

```
Device (192.168.1.5:1234) ──► Router ──► Internet (Public IP:5000)
                               NAT table: 192.168.1.5:1234 ↔ PublicIP:5000
```

This is why IPv4 hasn't completely run out — NAT multiplies addresses.

## 🔗 OSI Model (7 Layers)

| Layer | Name | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| 7 | Application | HTTP, DNS, SSH |
| 6 | Presentation | TLS, encryption |
| 5 | Session | Session management |
| 4 | Transport | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | IP routing |
| 2 | Data Link | Ethernet, MAC |
| 1 | Physical | Cables, WiFi signals |

For system design: mostly care about L3 (IP), L4 (TCP/UDP), L7 (HTTP).

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Every server has an IP + port — that's how clients find it
- TCP = reliable but slower; UDP = fast but unreliable
- Load balancers can operate at L4 (TCP) or L7 (HTTP)

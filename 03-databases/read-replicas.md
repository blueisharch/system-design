# 📖 Read Replicas

> **One-liner:** Copies of your primary database that handle read queries, freeing the primary to focus on writes.

---

## 📌 The Problem

Most web applications are **read-heavy** (80-90% reads, 10-20% writes).

A single database server handles both reads and writes → becomes a bottleneck.

```
All traffic → [Primary DB]
              CPU: 95% 🔥
              Connections: maxed out 🔥
```

---

## 💡 The Solution: Read Replicas

Add secondary copies of the database:
- **Primary** (Master) → handles all **writes**
- **Replicas** (Slaves) → handle all **reads**

```
[App Server 1] ──write──► [Primary DB] ──replicates──► [Replica 1]
[App Server 2] ──read──►  [Replica 1]                 [Replica 2]
[App Server 3] ──read──►  [Replica 2]
```

## 🔄 How Replication Works

### Synchronous Replication

```
Write → Primary → waits for Replica ACK → confirms to client
```
- ✅ Zero data loss — Replica always has latest data
- ❌ Higher write latency — must wait for replica confirmation

### Asynchronous Replication

```
Write → Primary → confirms to client → replicates to Replica in background
```
- ✅ Lower write latency
- ❌ Replica lag — reads might return slightly stale data
- ❌ If primary crashes before replication, data loss possible

### Semi-Synchronous

```
Write → Primary → waits for ACK from at least 1 replica → confirms
```
- Balance between safety and latency (MySQL's default option)

## 📊 Replication Lag

Replica lag is the delay between a write on primary and it being visible on replica.

| Lag | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| < 100ms | Usually fine — imperceptible to users |
| 100ms – 1s | Acceptable for most use cases |
| > 1s | Noticeable — "I just posted but I can't see it" bug |
| Minutes | Data consistency issue — investigate urgently |

### Handling Lag in Code

```javascript
// Read-after-write consistency: 
// After a user writes, route their next read to primary

async function getUserProfile(userId, justUpdated = false) {
  if (justUpdated) {
    return await primaryDB.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
  }
  return await replicaDB.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns

### Single Replica (Simple)

```
Writes → [Primary] → [Replica 1] ← Reads
```

### Multiple Replicas (Common)

```
         [Primary] ──► [Replica 1]  \
Writes →      │    ──► [Replica 2]  ──► Read traffic distributed
              └────► [Replica 3]  /
```

### Cascading Replicas

```
[Primary] → [Replica 1] → [Replica 2] → [Replica 3]
```
Reduces load on primary but increases replica lag.

### Regional Replicas (Multi-region)

```
[Primary - Mumbai] ──► [Replica - Singapore]
                   ──► [Replica - US-East]
```
Serve reads from the closest region to the user.

## 🔄 Failover: When Primary Dies

1. **Detect failure** — health check fails
2. **Elect new primary** — replica with least lag is promoted
3. **Redirect writes** — app/load balancer routes writes to new primary
4. **Old primary rejoins** — becomes a replica when it comes back

```
Before: App → Primary(A) → Replica(B)
Failure: Primary(A) dies
After:  App → Primary(B)   [B promoted]
              ↑
           Replica(A) [A rejoins as replica]
```

## ⚠️ Read Replica Caveats

| Caveat | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Eventual consistency** | Reads may return stale data |
| **Write bottleneck** | Replicas help reads; writes still limited to primary |
| **Complex routing** | Need to distinguish read vs write queries |
| **Cost** | Each replica = another database server |

## 🌍 When to Add Read Replicas

```
DB CPU > 70% sustained → add replica
Read:Write ratio > 5:1 → add replica  
Reporting queries slowing down app → add dedicated analytics replica
Multi-region users → add geo-replica
```

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Read replicas solve **read scalability** — writes still bottleneck on primary
- Use **async replication** for performance, **sync** for zero data loss
- Always handle **replica lag** in your application code
- Read replicas are the first step; sharding is the next if writes bottleneck

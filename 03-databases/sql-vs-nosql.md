# 🗄️ SQL vs NoSQL

> **One-liner:** SQL databases store data in structured tables with strict schemas; NoSQL databases trade strict consistency for flexibility and horizontal scalability.

---

## 📌 SQL (Relational Databases)

### Core Properties

- **Structured** — Data in tables with rows and columns
- **Schema** — Fixed structure, must be defined upfront
- **ACID** — Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **Relations** — Foreign keys, JOINs across tables
- **Query Language** — SQL (standardized)

### Examples

| Database | Best For |
|---------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | Complex queries, JSONB support, general purpose |
| MySQL | Web apps, e-commerce |
| SQLite | Local/embedded, mobile apps |
| Oracle | Enterprise, banking |
| MS SQL Server | Microsoft ecosystem |

### When to Use SQL

- ✅ Complex queries with JOINs
- ✅ Strong consistency required (banking, payments)
- ✅ Data is relational by nature (users → orders → products)
- ✅ ACID transactions needed
- ✅ Data structure is well-known and unlikely to change

## 📌 NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

### Core Properties

- **Flexible schema** — Add/remove fields without migrations
- **Horizontally scalable** — Designed to scale out
- **Eventual consistency** — Usually (some offer strong consistency)
- **Optimized for specific access patterns**

### Types of NoSQL

#### 1. Document Store
```json
// MongoDB, CouchDB, Firestore
{
  "_id": "user_123",
  "name": "Rahul",
  "address": { "city": "Delhi", "pin": "110001" },
  "tags": ["premium", "verified"]
}
```
Best for: User profiles, product catalogs, CMS

#### 2. Key-Value Store
```
Redis, DynamoDB, Memcached
"session:abc123" → { userId: 42, expiry: ... }
"counter:pageviews" → 1000000
```
Best for: Sessions, caching, real-time counters, leaderboards

#### 3. Column-Family Store
```
Cassandra, HBase
Row key → { column1: val, column2: val, column3: val }
```
Best for: Time-series data, IoT, write-heavy workloads, Netflix viewing history

#### 4. Graph Database
```
Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
Nodes (Person) → Edges (FOLLOWS) → Nodes (Person)
```
Best for: Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines

## ⚖️ The Comparison

| Dimension | SQL | NoSQL |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Schema | Fixed | Flexible |
| Horizontal scaling | Hard | Easy |
| Transactions | Full ACID | Often eventual consistency |
| JOINs | Easy | Avoid (denormalize) |
| Query flexibility | High (SQL) | Limited to access patterns |
| Learning curve | Moderate | Varies by type |
| Maturity | 50+ years | 15–20 years |

## 🔄 ACID vs BASE

### ACID (SQL)

| Property | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Atomicity** | All or nothing — transaction either fully succeeds or fully fails |
| **Consistency** | DB always goes from one valid state to another |
| **Isolation** | Concurrent transactions don't interfere |
| **Durability** | Once committed, data survives crashes |

### BASE (NoSQL)

| Property | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Basically Available** | System always responds (maybe stale data) |
| **Soft state** | State can change over time, even without input |
| **Eventually consistent** | System will eventually be consistent |

## 🏗️ Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL

```
Decision Tree:

Is the data relational?
├── Yes → SQL (start here)
└── No ↓
    Do you need flexible schema?
    ├── Yes → Document (MongoDB)
    └── No ↓
        Is it write-heavy time-series?
        ├── Yes → Column (Cassandra)
        └── No ↓
            Is it graph-traversal heavy?
            ├── Yes → Graph (Neo4j)
            └── No → Key-Value (Redis/DynamoDB)
```

## 🌍 Real-World Usage Patterns

| Company | SQL | NoSQL |
|---------|-----|-------|
| **Uber** | PostgreSQL (trips) | Cassandra (location updates) |
| **Netflix** | MySQL (billing) | Cassandra (viewing history) |
| **Instagram** | PostgreSQL (user data) | Redis (feed cache) |
| **Twitter** | MySQL | Redis (timeline), Cassandra (tweets) |
| **Airbnb** | MySQL | ElasticSearch (search) |

> Most large systems use **both** — polyglot persistence!

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Default to SQL** for new projects — better tooling, stronger guarantees
- **Move to NoSQL** when you hit specific scale/flexibility walls
- Most production systems use **both** (polyglot persistence)
- NoSQL doesn't mean "no schema" — you still have implicit structure

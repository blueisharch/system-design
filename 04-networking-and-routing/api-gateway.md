# 🚪 API Gateway

> **One-liner:** A single entry point for all client requests that handles cross-cutting concerns like auth, rate limiting, routing, and logging — so your microservices don't have to.

---

## 📌 The Problem

In a microservices architecture, clients would need to call many services directly:

```
Mobile App → auth-service:3001
           → user-service:3002
           → order-service:3003
           → payment-service:3004
           → notification-service:3005
```

Problems:
- Client needs to know every service's address
- Auth logic duplicated in every service
- CORS, rate limiting repeated everywhere
- No single point for monitoring

---

## 💡 The Solution: API Gateway

```
Mobile App ──────────────► [API Gateway]
                                │
                                ├─► auth-service
                                ├─► user-service
                                ├─► order-service
                                └─► payment-service
```

The gateway is the **single front door** to your backend.

## 🛠️ What API Gateways Do

### 1. Request Routing

```
POST /auth/login      → auth-service
GET  /users/:id       → user-service
POST /orders          → order-service
GET  /products        → product-service
```

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

```
Client → [Gateway]
          → Validate JWT token
          → If invalid: 401 Unauthorized (request never hits services)
          → If valid: forward with user context
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

```
User A: 100 requests/min → allow
User A: 101st request    → 429 Too Many Requests
```

### 4. SSL Termination

Handles HTTPS at the gateway; internal traffic can be HTTP.

### 5. Request/Response Transformation

```
Client sends:  { "user_id": 123 }
Gateway transforms to: { "userId": "user_123", "timestamp": "..." }
```

### 6. Load Balancing

Routes to healthy instances of each microservice.

### 7. Caching

Cache responses at the gateway level for frequently accessed data.

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

Single place to log all incoming requests, response times, error rates.

### 9. Circuit Breaking

If a downstream service is failing, stop sending requests → return cached/fallback response.

### 10. API Versioning

```
/v1/users → old-user-service (v1)
/v2/users → new-user-service (v2)
```

## ⚖️ API Gateway vs Load Balancer

| Feature | Load Balancer | API Gateway |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Primary role | Distribute traffic | Smart routing + cross-cutting concerns |
| Layer | L4 or L7 | L7 (always) |
| Authentication | ❌ | ✅ |
| Rate limiting | Limited | ✅ |
| Request transformation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Circuit breaking | ❌ | ✅ |
| Routing by path | L7 only | ✅ |
| Overhead | Low | Higher |

> Often used together: LB in front of API Gateway for the gateway's own HA.

## ⚖️ API Gateway vs Reverse Proxy

| Feature | Reverse Proxy | API Gateway |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Purpose | Forward requests, hide servers | Orchestrate microservices |
| Auth | ❌ | ✅ |
| Business logic | Minimal | Yes (routing rules, transforms) |
| Example | Nginx, HAProxy | Kong, AWS API Gateway |

## 🌍 Popular API Gateway Products

| Product | Type | Best For |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Kong** | Open source | Self-hosted, plugin ecosystem |
| **AWS API Gateway** | Managed | AWS ecosystem, serverless |
| **Nginx** | Open source | Can be configured as gateway |
| **Traefik** | Open source | Docker/Kubernetes native |
| **Apigee** | Enterprise | Google Cloud, enterprise features |
| **Azure API Management** | Managed | Azure ecosystem |

## ⚠️ Gateway Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Gateway is SPOF | If gateway dies, everything dies | Run multiple instances behind LB |
| Too much logic in gateway | Gateway becomes a monolith | Keep it thin — only cross-cutting concerns |
| High latency | Every request passes through gateway | Optimize, cache at gateway, keep logic light |
| Tight coupling | Gateway knows too much about services | Use routing rules, not business logic |

The diagram shows:
- Client → Gateway → multiple microservices
- Auth, Rate Limiting, Logging modules inside gateway
- Gateway cluster (multiple instances) behind a load balancer
- Circuit breaker to a failing service

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- API Gateway = **single entry point** + cross-cutting concerns
- Move auth, rate limiting, logging **out of services** and into the gateway
- The gateway can become a bottleneck/SPOF — make it HA and keep it lightweight
- Don't put business logic in the gateway — that belongs in services

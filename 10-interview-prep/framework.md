# System Design Interview Framework

> Clarify → Estimate → Design → Deep Dive → Trade-offs

---

## Time Management (45-minute interview)

| Phase | Time | What To Do |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Clarify Requirements | 5 min | Ask questions, nail scope |
| Estimate Scale | 5 min | DAU, QPS, storage |
| High-Level Design | 15 min | Core components, data flow |
| Deep Dive | 15 min | 2-3 components in detail |
| Trade-offs & Wrap-up | 5 min | Justify choices, limitations |

---

## Phase 1: Clarify Requirements (5 min)

Never assume. Always ask.

### Functional Questions
- "What are the core features I should design for?"
- "Should I include [feature X] or is that out of scope?"
- "What actions can a user take?"
- "Is real-time required, or eventual consistency is fine?"

### Non-Functional Questions
- "How many DAU are we targeting? 1M, 10M, 100M?"
- "What's the read-to-write ratio?"
- "What's the acceptable latency? < 100ms? < 1s?"
- "Do we need global distribution, or is one region fine?"
- "What's the durability requirement? Can we lose data?"

### Assumptions to State Out Loud
- "I'll assume 10M DAU to start"
- "I'll focus on the core read path first"
- "I'll skip auth for now unless you want me to cover it"

---

## Phase 2: Estimate Scale (5 min)

Show your math. Interviewers care about the process.

### Template

```
Users:
  Daily Active Users (DAU): X
  Monthly Active Users (MAU): Y

Traffic:
  Avg requests per user per day: N
  Total requests/day: X × N
  Read QPS: (X × N) / 86,400
  Write QPS: (read QPS) / (read:write ratio)
  Peak QPS: average × 2-3

Storage:
  Record size: (field sizes added up)
  New records/day: (write QPS × 86,400)
  Annual growth: (daily × 365)
  5-year storage: (annual × 5)

Bandwidth:
  Outbound: read QPS × avg response size
```

---

## Phase 2b: API Design (part of HLD)

Design the core API endpoints before diving into architecture. Interviewers notice when you skip this.

### Template
```
Method  Endpoint                 Description
POST    /api/v1/tweets           Create a tweet
GET     /api/v1/tweets/{id}      Get a tweet
GET     /api/v1/feed             Get home timeline
POST    /api/v1/follow/{userId}  Follow a user
DELETE  /api/v1/follow/{userId}  Unfollow

Request body:  { field: type, ... }
Response:      { id, data, metadata, cursor }
Auth:          Bearer JWT in Authorization header
Versioning:    /v1/ prefix — plan for /v2/ if schema may change
```

### Common API Decisions to State Out Loud
- REST vs gRPC (external vs internal)
- Pagination: cursor-based or offset-based?
- Rate limits per endpoint (stricter on writes)
- Idempotency keys for non-idempotent mutations

---

## Phase 2c: DB Schema (part of HLD)

Sketch the core tables/collections before drawing boxes.

### SQL Template
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id        BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  username  VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email     VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE tweets (
  id         BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id    BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),
  content    TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes to mention:
CREATE INDEX idx_tweets_user_id ON tweets(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tweets_created_at ON tweets(created_at DESC);
```

### DB Schema Decisions to State Out Loud
- Why SQL vs NoSQL for this table?
- What's the shard key if you need to shard?
- Which columns need indexes (and why)?
- Will this table be read-heavy or write-heavy?

---

## Phase 3: High-Level Design (15 min)

### Start With This Skeleton
```
[Client] → [CDN (static)] / [API Gateway (dynamic)]
                 │
           [Load Balancer]
                 │
        [App Services / APIs]
          │           │
     [Cache]      [Databases]
                      │
               [Object Storage]
```

Then evolve it based on the specific problem.

### Key Components to Know Cold

| Component | When to add |
|-----------|------------|
| CDN | Images, static files, global users |
| Load Balancer | Multiple app instances |
| API Gateway | Microservices, auth, rate limiting |
| Cache (Redis) | Read-heavy, repeated queries |
| Read Replicas | Read:write > 5:1 |
| Message Queue | Async operations, decoupling |
| Object Storage (S3) | Images, videos, files |
| Search (Elasticsearch) | Full-text search |

---

## Phase 4: Deep Dive (15 min)

Pick the 2-3 hardest parts and go deep.

### Common Deep Dive Areas

**For feed/timeline:**
- Fan-out on read vs write vs hybrid
- How do you handle celebrities (hotspots)?

**For storage:**
- Why this DB? SQL vs NoSQL? Schema design?
- How do you shard? What's the shard key?

**For reliability:**
- What happens when a service goes down?
- How do you handle duplicate messages?
- What's your retry strategy?

**For scale:**
- How does this handle 10× the traffic?
- Where's the bottleneck? How do you fix it?

---

## Phase 5: Trade-offs (5 min)

For every major decision, state:

```
"I chose X over Y because [reason].
The trade-off is [downside of X].
This is acceptable because [justification]."
```

### Common Trade-off Pairs

| Option A | vs | Option B | Key Factor |
|----------|----|---------|-----------|
| SQL | vs | NoSQL | Structure vs scale |
| Consistency | vs | Availability | CAP theorem |
| Fan-out on write | vs | Fan-out on read | Read latency vs write fan-out |
| Sync replication | vs | Async | Durability vs latency |
| Monolith | vs | Microservices | Simplicity vs scale |
| Cache-aside | vs | Write-through | Freshness vs complexity |

---

## Interviewer Signal Words

Watch for these hints:

| Interviewer Says | They Want You To |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "How would this scale?" | Add caching, sharding, load balancing |
| "What if a server fails?" | Discuss HA, failover, replication |
| "What if this is slow?" | Add caching, CDN, async processing |
| "How would you ensure no data loss?" | Replication, WAL, backups |
| "What's the bottleneck?" | Identify weakest link, suggest fix |
| "What would you do differently with more time?" | Discuss optimizations you skipped |

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Jump to solution without clarifying | Spend 5 min on requirements |
| Design for "infinite scale" immediately | Match design to stated scale |
| Ignore non-functional requirements | Always discuss latency, availability |
| Never state trade-offs | Every choice has a downside — say it |
| Single server database | At any reasonable scale, think about replication |
| Ignore failure cases | "What if X fails?" is always fair game |
| Use only one database | Most real systems are polyglot |

---

## Cheat Sheet: Scale → Architecture

```
< 1K users:       Single server + DB
< 10K users:      Separate app and DB servers
< 100K users:     Add caching (Redis), basic CDN
< 1M users:       Load balancer, read replicas, message queue
< 10M users:      DB sharding, microservices, multi-region CDN
< 100M users:     Everything distributed, multiple data centers
> 100M users:     You need a whole team of architects
```

## Advanced Patterns (Deep Dive Reference)

### Resilience Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker** — stop calling a failing service; fail fast, recover gracefully → [circuit-breaker.md](../12-modern-patterns/circuit-breaker.md)
- **Retry with Backoff** — exponential backoff + jitter to avoid thundering herd → [failure-resilience.md](../16-failure-resilience/failure-resilience.md)
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** — capture messages that repeatedly fail processing
- **Graceful Degradation** — return cached/partial data instead of erroring out

### Coordination Patterns
- **Leader Election** — one node coordinates; use Zookeeper or Raft → [leader-election.md](../patterns/leader-election.md)
- **Distributed Locks** — Redis SETNX / Redlock for mutual exclusion → [distributed-locks.md](../12-modern-patterns/distributed-locks.md)
- **Distributed Cron** — leader-elected scheduler + idempotent jobs → [distributed-cron.md](../patterns/distributed-cron.md)
- **Idempotency Keys** — safe retries on writes; store result keyed by client ID → [idempotency.md](../12-modern-patterns/idempotency.md)

### Data Patterns
- **Cache Invalidation** — TTL vs event-driven vs write-through strategies → [cache-invalidation.md](../patterns/cache-invalidation.md)
- **Rate Limiter Designs** — token bucket, leaky bucket, sliding window → [rate-limiter-designs.md](../patterns/rate-limiter-designs.md)
- **Saga Pattern** — distributed transactions via choreography or orchestration → [saga-pattern.md](../07-microservices/saga-pattern.md)

### Observability
- **Metrics** — counters, gauges, histograms (Prometheus/CloudWatch)
- **Tracing** — distributed trace IDs across services (Jaeger, X-Ray)
- **Logging** — structured logs, correlation IDs, log aggregation → [observability.md](../12-modern-patterns/observability.md)

## Multi-Region & Global Scale

When the interviewer asks about global users or disaster recovery:

```
Strategy        | RTO  | RPO  | Cost
Active-Passive  | mins | secs | Medium
Active-Active   | secs | ~0   | High
Read Replicas   | n/a  | secs | Low (read-only)
```

- **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) — how fast you recover
- **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) — how much data you can afford to lose
- Geo-DNS routes users to nearest region
- Conflict resolution needed for active-active writes → [multi-region.md](../13-multi-region/multi-region.md)

---

## Edge Computing Consideration

Mention edge when: low latency is critical, content is personalized but cacheable, or you need to run logic close to the user.

- Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge, Fastly Compute
- Good for: auth checks, A/B testing, geo-routing, image resizing
- Not good for: heavy compute, stateful operations, DB writes → [edge-computing.md](../15-edge-computing/edge-computing.md)

---

## Cost Optimization Notes (for "production-ready" signal)

Mentioning cost shows senior thinking:
- **Storage tiering** — hot (SSD) → warm (HDD) → cold (S3 Glacier)
- **Spot/preemptible instances** — for async workers and batch jobs
- **Caching as cost reduction** — fewer DB reads = lower bill
- **Right-sizing** — don't over-provision; use auto-scaling → [cost-optimization.md](../14-cost-optimization/cost-optimization.md)

---

## API Design — Advanced Signals

Things that impress interviewers at senior level:
- **Cursor-based pagination** over offset (consistent under inserts)
- **Partial responses** (`?fields=id,name`) to reduce bandwidth
- **Idempotency headers** (`Idempotency-Key`) on POST/PUT
- **GraphQL trade-offs** — flexible queries, but N+1 and caching complexity
- **Deprecation strategy** — sunset headers, versioned endpoints → [api-design-advanced.md](../17-api-design-advanced/api-design-advanced.md)

---

## Security Checklist (mention when relevant)

- Auth: JWT for stateless, OAuth for delegated, session tokens for stateful
- HTTPS everywhere; TLS termination at load balancer
- Rate limiting at API Gateway layer (per IP, per user)
- DDoS: CDN absorbs volumetric attacks; WAF for application-layer
- Input validation at the edge; never trust client data → [auth-jwt-oauth.md](../11-security/auth-jwt-oauth.md) | [ddos-protection.md](../11-security/ddos-protection.md)

# 🔐 Distributed Locks

> **One-liner:** A distributed lock ensures that only one node in a cluster can perform a critical operation at a time — preventing race conditions across services.

## ❓ Why Do You Need Distributed Locks?

In a single-server world, a mutex or semaphore handles concurrency. But in distributed systems:
- Multiple service replicas run simultaneously
- They all share the same database or resource
- Without coordination, two instances might process the same job, double-charge a user, or corrupt shared state

**Classic example:** Flash sale — 100 units in stock, 10,000 concurrent requests. Without a lock, you oversell.

## 🔑 Redis Distributed Lock (Redlock)

The most common approach: use Redis `SET NX EX`.

```bash
# Acquire lock
SET lock:resource_id <unique_token> NX EX 10
# NX = only set if key does NOT exist
# EX 10 = auto-expire in 10 seconds (TTL safety net)

# Returns OK → you have the lock
# Returns nil → someone else has it

# Release lock (Lua script — atomic!)
if redis.call("GET", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
  return redis.call("DEL", KEYS[1])
else
  return 0
end
```

**Why a unique token?** Prevents a slow process from releasing a lock that was already acquired by someone else after TTL expiry.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Step by Step)

```
Service A                    Redis                   Service B
   |                           |                        |
   |── SET lock:job1 tokenA ──>|                        |
   |   NX EX 10                |                        |
   |<── OK (lock acquired) ────|                        |
   |                           |                        |
   |   (doing work...)         |── SET lock:job1 ──────>|
   |                           |   tokenB NX EX 10      |
   |                           |<── nil (locked) ───────|
   |                           |   (retry or fail)      |
   |                           |                        |
   |── DEL lock:job1 ─────────>|                        |
   |   (if token matches)      |                        |
   |<── lock released ─────────|                        |
```

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Gotchas

| Problem | What Happens | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Process crashes | Lock stuck forever | TTL auto-expire |
| Network partition | Two leaders think they have lock | Redlock (multi-node) |
| GC pause longer than TTL | Process resumes, lock already expired | Fencing tokens |
| Redis crashes | Lock lost | Use Redis Cluster / persistence |

### Fencing Token Pattern
Each lock acquisition returns a monotonically increasing token number. The resource (e.g., DB) only accepts writes with tokens higher than the last seen:

```
Lock acquired → token 42
Lock expired, re-acquired → token 43
Stale process tries to write with token 42 → REJECTED
```

## 🏛️ Alternatives to Redis Locks

| Tool | Mechanism | Use When |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Redis (SET NX)** | Atomic key-value | Most common, low latency |
| **ZooKeeper** | Ephemeral nodes + watchers | Need strong consistency |
| **etcd** | Leases + CAS | Kubernetes-style infra |
| **DB row lock** | `SELECT FOR UPDATE` | Already using SQL, low scale |

## ✅ Pros

- Sub-millisecond lock acquisition with Redis
- TTL prevents deadlocks from crashed processes
- Simple to implement with `SET NX EX`
- Scales with Redis Cluster

## ❌ Cons

- Redis is single point of failure (use Redlock for HA)
- Clock drift can cause issues with TTL-based expiry
- Redlock is controversial (Martin Kleppmann vs. Antirez debate)
- Not suitable for long-held locks (use queue instead)

## ⚖️ When to Use / When NOT to Use

**✅ Use when:**
- Preventing double processing (payment, job scheduling)
- Flash sales / inventory deduction
- Leader election among service instances
- Rate limiting per resource

**❌ Avoid when:**
- Operations take longer than a reasonable TTL (use idempotency + queue instead)
- You need guaranteed strong consistency (use ZooKeeper + fencing)
- The resource is already serialized (single-threaded queue consumer)

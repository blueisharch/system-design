# 🗺️ Service Discovery

> **One-liner:** Service discovery is how microservices find each other at runtime — instead of hardcoding IP addresses, services register themselves and clients look them up dynamically.

## ❓ The Problem

In microservices, services run on dynamic infrastructure:
- Container IPs change on every restart
- Services scale up/down constantly
- Multiple instances run behind a load balancer
- New versions deploy and old ones disappear

**Hardcoding IPs breaks instantly.** You need a phone book that updates itself.

## 🏗️ Two Patterns

### 1. Client-Side Discovery
The client asks a **Service Registry** directly, then calls the service.

```
Client  ──► Registry: "Where is payment-service?"
        ◄── Registry: "192.168.1.5:3001, 192.168.1.6:3001"
Client  ──► payment-service:3001 (client picks one, does LB itself)
```

**Tools:** Eureka (Netflix), Consul

**Pros:** Client controls load balancing logic  
**Cons:** Client must have discovery library for every language

---

### 2. Server-Side Discovery
The client calls a **Load Balancer / API Gateway**, which does the lookup.

```
Client  ──► Load Balancer: "POST /payments"
LB      ──► Registry: "Where is payment-service?"
        ◄── Registry: "192.168.1.5:3001"
LB      ──► payment-service:3001
        ◄── Response
Client  ◄── Response
```

**Tools:** AWS ALB + ECS, Kubernetes, Nginx + Consul

**Pros:** Client is dumb (no discovery code needed)  
**Cons:** Extra hop, LB is a potential bottleneck

## 📋 Service Registry

The central database of "who's alive and where."

### Registration (how services join)
```
# Self-registration: service registers itself on startup
POST /v1/agent/service/register
{
  "Name": "payment-service",
  "ID": "payment-service-1",
  "Address": "192.168.1.5",
  "Port": 3001,
  "Check": {
    "HTTP": "http://192.168.1.5:3001/health",
    "Interval": "10s"   ← health check every 10 seconds
  }
}

# Third-party registration: orchestrator registers (Kubernetes does this)
```

### Health Checks
Registry pings each registered service. If it fails N times → marked unhealthy → removed from discovery results.

## 🔧 Tools Comparison

| Tool | Type | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **Consul** | Client-side + KV store | Multi-DC, service mesh |
| **Eureka** (Netflix) | Client-side | Spring Boot microservices |
| **etcd** | Key-value + watch | Kubernetes backbone |
| **Kubernetes DNS** | Server-side | K8s native (just use it) |
| **AWS Cloud Map** | Server-side | AWS ECS/EKS |
| **Zookeeper** | Client-side | Older Kafka setups |

### Kubernetes DNS (simplest)
In K8s, services get a DNS name automatically:
```
payment-service.default.svc.cluster.local
# format: <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
```
Just call `http://payment-service/pay` — K8s handles the rest.

## ✅ Pros

- No hardcoded IPs — services survive restarts and scaling
- Automatic health check integration
- Enables zero-downtime deployments
- Foundation for service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

## ❌ Cons

- Registry itself is a single point of failure (needs HA)
- Adds operational complexity
- Stale entries possible if TTL/health checks are misconfigured
- Client-side pattern requires polyglot library support

## ⚖️ When to Use / When NOT to Use

**✅ Use when:**
- Running 5+ microservices that need to communicate
- Containers restart with changing IPs
- Auto-scaling groups where instance count changes
- Multi-region deployments

**❌ Avoid / not needed when:**
- Monolith or 2-3 services with stable IPs
- Already on Kubernetes (use built-in DNS — no extra tool needed)
- Services communicate only through a message queue (no direct calls)

# 🌍 Multi-Region & Geo-Distribution

> Senior-level signal 💯 — most candidates skip this entirely. Knowing this separates you.

## Why Multi-Region?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Latency** | Serve users from the nearest region (100ms vs 400ms) |
| **Availability** | One region down ≠ whole system down |
| **Compliance** | GDPR, data residency laws (EU data must stay in EU) |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Survive regional cloud outages (AWS us-east-1 has gone down) |

## 🗺️ Deployment Models

### Active-Passive
- One region handles ALL traffic
- Passive region is on standby (warm or cold)
- Failover takes time (seconds to minutes)
- ✅ Simpler, cheaper
- ❌ Wasted capacity, failover downtime

### Active-Active
- Multiple regions ALL handle traffic simultaneously
- Load balanced across regions
- ✅ Full utilization, instant failover
- ❌ Data consistency is HARD (writes to two regions = conflict risk)

---

## 🔄 Data Replication Across Regions

### Synchronous Replication
- Write confirms only after all replicas ACK
- ✅ Zero data loss
- ❌ High latency (write waits for far region)

### Asynchronous Replication
- Write confirms after primary writes; replicas catch up
- ✅ Low write latency
- ❌ Replication lag — RPO > 0 (can lose recent writes on failover)

### Conflict Resolution (Active-Active)
- **Last Write Wins (LWW)** — timestamp determines winner (risk: clock skew)
- **Vector Clocks** — track causality, not just time
- **CRDTs** — data structures that merge automatically (counters, sets)
- **Application-level** — humans or business logic resolves conflicts

## 🧭 Latency-Based Routing

Route users to the nearest healthy region:

```
User in London → EU-WEST region
User in Singapore → AP-SOUTHEAST region
User in NYC → US-EAST region
```

**How it works:**
- DNS-level routing (Route 53 latency routing, Cloudflare)
- Measures latency from user to each region endpoint
- Routes to lowest-latency region
- Falls back to next region if primary is unhealthy

**Other routing strategies:**
- **Geolocation routing** — by country/continent (compliance use case)
- **Weighted routing** — 90% to main region, 10% to new region (blue/green)
- **Failover routing** — primary + health check → failover on failure

## 💥 Disaster Recovery Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective — how long can system be down? |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective — how much data can we lose? |
| **Failover** | Switch traffic to backup region |
| **Failback** | Return to primary after recovery |
| **Runbook** | Step-by-step incident playbook |

### DR Tiers

| Tier | RTO | RPO | Cost | Strategy |
|------|-----|-----|------|---------|
| Cold Standby | Hours | Hours | $ | Data backed up, infra off |
| Warm Standby | Minutes | Minutes | $$ | Infra running, minimal traffic |
| Hot Standby | Seconds | Seconds | $$$ | Full mirror, active-active |

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

✅ **Pros**
- Sub-100ms latency for global users
- Survives regional cloud outages
- Compliance with data residency laws

❌ **Cons**
- Data consistency is fundamentally harder
- Cost multiplier (2x–3x infrastructure)
- Operational complexity (multi-region debugging, data sync issues)

⚖️ **When to use**
- Global user base (users in 3+ continents)
- SLAs requiring 99.99%+ uptime
- Revenue impact of downtime > cost of multi-region

**When NOT to use**
- Small startup with users in one country
- Early stage — single-region with good backups is fine

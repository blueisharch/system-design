# ⚡ Edge Computing

> CDN serves static files. Edge computing runs **logic** at the edge. This is the next level.

## CDN vs Edge Computing

| | CDN | Edge Computing |
|--|-----|----------------|
| **What it does** | Caches static files (HTML, JS, images) | Runs code at edge nodes |
| **Dynamic content** | ❌ Must go to origin | ✅ Can compute at edge |
| **Latency** | Low for cache hits | Low even for dynamic responses |
| **Examples** | CloudFront, Fastly | Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge, Deno Deploy |

## 🧠 Edge Functions

Code that runs in the CDN network, geographically close to users.

**Runtimes:**
- **Cloudflare Workers** — V8 isolates, JS/WASM, 0ms cold start
- **Lambda@Edge** — AWS, triggered by CloudFront, higher cold starts
- **Vercel Edge Functions** — built on Cloudflare Workers
- **Deno Deploy** — TypeScript-native

**Constraints:**
- No filesystem access
- Limited CPU time (1–50ms budgets)
- Limited memory (~128MB)
- No long-running processes
- Some have no Node.js APIs (use Web APIs only)

## 🔑 Use Cases

### 1. Authentication & Authorization at the Edge
```
User → Edge Node → check JWT → valid? → forward to origin
                              invalid? → return 401 immediately
```
- Block unauthenticated requests before they hit your servers
- No round-trip to origin for auth validation
- Reduces load on origin by rejecting bad requests early

### 2. Personalization
```
User request hits edge →
  Read cookie / geo / device header →
  Rewrite URL or inject headers →
  Serve personalized variant
```
- A/B testing without origin involvement
- Locale-based content (language, currency)
- Device-based content (mobile vs desktop)

### 3. Bot Detection & Rate Limiting
- Block bots at the edge before they consume origin resources
- Cloudflare's Bot Management runs entirely at edge

### 4. Request/Response Transformation
- Add security headers (CSP, HSTS) to every response
- Strip sensitive headers before forwarding
- Rewrite URLs for legacy compatibility

### 5. Geo-Based Redirects
```javascript
// Cloudflare Worker example
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const country = request.cf.country;
    if (country === 'DE') {
      return Response.redirect('https://de.example.com' + request.url);
    }
    return fetch(request);
  }
}
```

## 🗺️ Edge vs Origin Decision Tree

```
Is the response the same for all users?
  YES → CDN cache it (static)
  NO  → Does personalization need server state/DB?
          NO  → Edge function (compute from request headers/cookies)
          YES → Origin server (but edge can cache origin response per variant)
```

## 📦 Edge KV Storage

Some edge platforms offer distributed key-value stores accessible from edge:
- **Cloudflare KV** — globally replicated, eventual consistency, low-latency reads
- **Cloudflare Durable Objects** — strongly consistent, single-region, great for coordination

Use for:
- Feature flags
- Rate limit counters (approximate)
- Session data
- Config that changes infrequently

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

✅ **Pros**
- Sub-10ms response for many use cases
- Reduces load and cost on origin servers
- No infrastructure to manage (serverless)
- Global presence instantly

❌ **Cons**
- No access to databases or internal services directly
- Limited runtime environment (no full Node.js)
- Debugging is harder (distributed, remote)
- Cold start exists (minimal but nonzero for Lambda@Edge)
- Vendor lock-in (Cloudflare Workers API ≠ Lambda@Edge API)

⚖️ **When to use**
- Auth validation, bot blocking, geo-redirects
- A/B testing, personalization headers
- Performance-critical responses that don't need DB

**When NOT to use**
- Complex business logic requiring DB queries
- Long-running operations
- When you need full OS / filesystem access

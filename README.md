# System Design Notes

> A structured, self-paced knowledge base for mastering system design — from core fundamentals to production-grade architectural patterns.

---

## Overview

This repository contains personal study notes, diagrams, and reference material focused on building a deep, practical understanding of large-scale distributed systems. The content is organized to support both interview preparation and real-world engineering insight.

**Goals:**

- Build a strong foundation in distributed systems and architecture
- Understand trade-offs between competing design choices
- Prepare effectively for system design interviews at top-tier companies

## Opening Diagrams

Every topic includes a corresponding `.excalidraw` diagram located in the `diagrams/` folder.

**Option 1 — Browser:**

1. Go to [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)
2. Click **≡** (top-left menu) → **Open**
3. Select the relevant `.excalidraw` file from the `diagrams/` folder

**Option 2 — VS Code:**
Install the [Excalidraw extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor) and open any `.excalidraw` file directly from the editor.

## Interview Framework

A repeatable, structured approach to tackling any system design question:

```
1. Clarify Requirements     →  Functional & non-functional (scale, latency, availability)
2. Estimate Scale           →  DAU, QPS, storage needs, bandwidth
3. API Design               →  Endpoints, methods, request/response contracts
4. Database Schema          →  Tables, indexes, shard key selection
5. High-Level Design        →  Core components and data flow
6. Deep Dive                →  Detail 2–3 critical components
7. Scaling Strategy         →  Identify bottlenecks and mitigation approaches
8. Trade-offs               →  Justify your choices; acknowledge alternatives
```

## The Trade-offs Mindset

Every topic in this repository is analyzed through the following lens:

| Dimension           | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Pros**            | What this approach does well            |
| **Cons**            | Its limitations and failure modes       |
| **When to use**     | The right context for this choice       |
| **When NOT to use** | Where it breaks down or introduces risk |

This structure directly mirrors what interviewers are looking for when they ask _"Why did you choose X over Y?"_
